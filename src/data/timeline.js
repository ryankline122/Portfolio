        ' As a software engineering intern at DISHER, I have had the opportunity to work on a range of exciting projects that have helped me develop my technical skills and gain valuable experience in the field. For example, I collaborated with a team of engineering interns to design and build a device that improved remote access to our electronics lab. I also developed, updated, and maintained unit and system tests on an autonomous rover. Additionally, I created an interactive marketing application that was displayed around the office to showcase DISHER\'s culture to prospective clients and new hires. Currently, I am working on developing an inventory system using the Django web framework. Through these projects, I have gained valuable experience in software development, testing, and collaboration, and have demonstrated my ability to deliver high-quality results in a fast-paced, team-oriented environment.'
